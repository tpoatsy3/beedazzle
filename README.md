# BeeDazzle

`beedazzle` is a companion to the New York Times' Spelling Bee game.

## Introduction

### Spelling Bee Gameplay
Spelling Bee is a game that asks you to make as many words as you can from a list of 7 letters. The created words must meet some basic requriements:
* They must be at least 4 letters in length
* They must contain the 'center letter'.
* They must be found in the NYT's dictionary

In addition, you can use a letter multiple times while creating a word.

## Getting Started

### Loading A Word Bank
NYT's Spelling Bee checks any entered word against an English dictionary that's curated by the New York Times itself. Since they do not publish their dictionary, `beedazzle` allows you to upload your own dictionary, or use the default one provided in this package. If you choose to upload your own, you can do so by running

```
python beedazzle load_dict dict_file
```
